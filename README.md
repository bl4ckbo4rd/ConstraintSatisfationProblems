# ConstraintSatisfationProblems
This repository contains BP based algorithms to solve single instances of constraint satisfaction problems such as K-Xorsat or K-Sat. 
The project is very general in the way in which BP equations are implemented and different problems can be specified by simply changing the type of the factor clause. Thus the code is non optimized.
A detailed explaination of some of these methods can be found in the book "Information, Physics and Computation" by A. Montanari and M. Mezard.
