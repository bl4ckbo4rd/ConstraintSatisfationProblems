# ConstraintSatisfationProblems
This repository contains BP based algorithms to solve single instances of constraint satisfaction problems such as K-Xorsat or K-Sat. A detailed explaination of some of these methods can be found in the book "Information, Physics and Computation" by A. Montanari and M. Mezard.
